                                    Our nation requires 4 Crore Units of Blood while only 40 lakh units are available,
                                    Every two seconds someone needs Blood
                                    There is no substitute for Human Blood. It cannot be manufactured<br />
                                    Blood donation is an extremely noble deed, yet there is a scarcity of regular donors across India.
                                    We focus on creating & expanding a virtual army of blood donating volunteers who could be searched and contacted by family / care givers of a patient in times of need
